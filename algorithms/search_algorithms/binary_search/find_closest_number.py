"""
Given an array of sorted integers. We need to find the closest value to the 
given number.

Array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers.

Examples:

    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}

    Target number = 11
    Output : 9
    9 is closest to 11 in given array

    Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9};
    Target number = 4
    Output : 5
